==[#1] PerlTkTheme==

PerlTkTheme is a GTK 3 theme with some support for GTKs 2 & 4, with some colors 
and embossed widgets inspired by the good old classic Perl/Tk, Tcl/Tk and 
Motif look.  

I'm old and grew up using CDE on Solaris and NextStep / Bowman / AfterStep 
window managers, and Perl/Tk.  I still use AfterStep as my daily driver on 
Linux and my code editor, file-manager, and some of my other daily-driver apps 
I wrote myself in Perl/Tk.  My goal was to try to pretty up ("unify") my 
desktop a bit, so my other apps (GTK-3 mostly, but also some Qt) wouldn't look 
so radically different than my in-house Perl/Tk apps!  Since Perl/Tk is ancient 
and not "themeable" (except for colors) - the Perl/Tk author died in the early 
2000s before he could add skins/themes, so it is what it is!  Therefore, I 
sought out a path of less resistance seeking a better theme for GTK (My Qt 
apps use qt5ct to better align with GTK(2) already, and I ran across one called 
"OneStepBack" by Jean-Pierre Bucciol 
(http://www.vide.memoire.free.fr/perso/OneStepBack/onestepback.php) which 
looked much closer to what I was looking for, and which offered configurable 
colors (I use Perl/Tk's setPalette feature and .Xdefaults to have all my 
Perl/Tk apps in a set color-scheme b/c the default is a bland, ugly off-white) 
and most GTK themes take the Henry Ford attitude that "you can have any color 
you like as long as it's light-grey or dark-grey!"  I then set about to change 
the colors to look more like my chosen Perl/Tk color palette and ended up 
redesigning the color-configuration parameters to better support this (and 
added a handy color-changer configurator script (configure) to make it easier 
for other users to change them on the fly to their desired palettes).  I also 
tweaked some of the widget beveling styles, added a separate "dark" image 
directory since many images have "normal" and "disabled" versions designed for 
"light" theme backgrounds, but look much better reversed if you have your 
theme set to a "dark" background, so I use symlinks there to flip them!  Then I 
created "-tk" versions of the checkbox and radio-button icons to look like the 
ones Tk uses:  square beveled checkbox buttons and diamond-shaped radio-buttons.

While we can't match Tk exactly in GTK-3, and only partially in GTK-2, I've 
gotten close enough to be much better than other GTK themes.  I confess I still 
prefer the classic "nineties" look (and am used to it after three decades of 
daily computer programming and usage).  In the nineties, we had CDE and Fvwm, 
and Windows-XP with beautiful pastel colors and highlights, beveled square 
buttons that stuck out at you begging to be pressed and that aligned well 
together in nice neat rows, text fields sunk in or were ridged so you could see 
where you needed to enter data, etc. before Apple/Micro$oft/Gnome consipired 
together to give us a flat, drab, grey and uninspiring desktop existance.  
I find "Top Ten Best Gnome Themes" webpages and they all look alike to me, just 
different icons - eight of 'em will be the same dark-grey and the other two 
washed out off-white/light grey.  So, if you're into the "retro" look, or just 
want something actually different, and want to actually change the color 
palette (instead of just the foreground and perhaps a cpl. others), or use a 
lot of Perl/Tk or Tck/Tk apps, then give PerlTkTheme a try today!
