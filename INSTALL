Installation from GitHub is fairly simple.  First:

1)  mkdir /home/<username>/.themes/PerlTkTheme

2)  git clone https://github.com/wildstar84/PerlTkTheme.git /home/<username>/.themes/PerlTkTheme/

3)  cd /home/<username>/.themes/PerlTkTheme

4)  Run the handy color-configurator script:  ./configure

	This will ask you for a color-name or number (#xxxxxx) for your desired 
base default background color.  It will generate both GTK-3 and GTK-2 versions 
of the theme.  Note:  You can easily rerun this script at any time and it will 
change the theme's colors to the new colors automatically when you launch new 
apps.  It also saves the new color-scheme theme files as (gtk.css.color (GTK-3) 
and gtkrc.color (GTK-2)), backs up your previous ones as gtk.css.backup and 
gtkrc.backup.  It them symlinks the theme files (gtk.css and gtkrc) to the 
corresponding ones of the new colors.  It does NOT change your system theme 
setup (ie from another theme to PerlTkTheme).  You must do that (one-time) 
manually as follows:

5)  For gtk-3, edit your /home/<username>/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini (OR 
use whatever GUI or method your system uses for changing GTK-3 themes) and 
add the line:  "gtk-theme-name=PerlTkTheme" and comment out the corresponing 
line that says:  "gtk-theme-name=YourCurrentThemeName".

    For gtk-2, edit your /home/<username>/.gtkrc-2.0 file (OR use whatever GUI 
or method your system uses for changing GTK-2 themes) and add the line:  
"gtk-theme-name="PerlTkTheme"" and comment out the corresponding line that 
says:  ""gtk-theme-name="YourCurrentThemeName""  (note the quotes around the 
theme-name!

6)  For Qt apps, you will need to use a program called "qt5ct", which 
hopefully is in your distro's repositories, run it (a GUI), set the "Style" 
to "gtk2" (gtk3 is not currently supported afaik), and add an environment 
variable in your window-manager startup:  "export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct", 
and your Qt apps should now use the GTK-2 version of the theme.

At this point, you should be all set to launch GTK-3, GTK-2, and Qt apps using 
your new theme and colors! looking (very similar to) your Perl/Tk and 
TCL/TK apps!

I recommend this method of installation (as a user-theme, as opposed to a 
system-theme), since:  1) It supports nearly unlimited different color-palettes 
(unlike most GTK themes which take the Henry Ford approach of "any color you 
want as long as it's dark or light gray") and other users may not like having 
this colorful retro theme imposed on them; and 2) I would expect most users to 
wish to have different user accounts themed in different colors, or even 
different themes (If PerlTkTheme is a system-theme, it will have the same color 
palette for all users, and only ROOT can change them).  If you want to install 
as a system theme, you'll need to instead install it in /usr/share/themes/ 
(as ROOT) instead of /home/<username>/.themes/ .

Enjoy!
