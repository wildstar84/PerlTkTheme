The separate directory "img-dark/" was created (by Jim Turner) to allow for 
different images for "dark" versions of the themes.  Most of the "dark version" 
images are simply symlinks to their corresponding "light" versions in the 
original image directory "img/".  The ones that require different dark and 
light versions (mostly arrow buttons) have a "normal" version that is black in 
the middle and a "disabled" version that is light-grey or white in the middle.  
This is hard to read in "dark" themes, so we cross-symlinked the "normal" ones 
here to the corresponding "disabled" ones there (and vice versa) so that in 
either theme style, the "normal" ones stand out significantly more than their 
"disabled" counterparts.

An unrelated but additional image feature (added by Jim Turner) are all the 
images that end in "-tk.png".  These replace the corresponding image files that 
lack the "-tk" and represent checkboxes and radio-buttons in Perl/Tk style 
(which this theme is all about).  If the user wishes to use the original 
images instead, they should edit the gtk-css file and remove the "-tk" from 
the image urls for which they wish to use the original image (all the original 
images remain in the "img/" directory and are symlinked from "img-dark/".
