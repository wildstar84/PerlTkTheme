This "Custom" image directory is only used by gtk.css.160028.Mine and has 
custom "color-coordinated" versions of certain images, and is only presented 
here to demonstrate what users who wish to stick with a specific color-scheme 
can do (if they're willing to go to the extra effort to make the images exactly 
match their chosen color-scheme.
